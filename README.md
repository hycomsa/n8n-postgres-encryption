# n8n-postgres-encryption

This repo contains [n8n](n8n.io) node and credentials for a custom Postgres integration. It adds support for ssmode=verify* (similarly to [SSL support for MySQL](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/1644/files)). Includes the node linter and other dependencies.
Credentials testing for non API-based credentials does not work properly in n8n, so do not focus on errors related to "Couldnâ€™t connect with these settings. No testing function found for this credential."

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 16. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).
* Install n8n with:
	```
	npm install n8n -g
	```
* Recommended: follow n8n's guide to [set up your development environment](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/node-development-environment/).
